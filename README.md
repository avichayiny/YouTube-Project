# You-Tube Project
This repository contains a full-stack YouTube-style platform developed as part of a Advanced System Programming course. The system includes:

Web Client (React): A modern front-end built with React that allows users to browse, upload, and interact with videos.

Android Client: A native Android application that provides similar functionality to the web version, tailored for mobile devices.

Server-side (Node.js): A backend service implemented in Node.js that handles API requests, user authentication, and communication with the database.

Database: A MongoDB database used to store video metadata, user data, comments, likes, and more.

Recommendation Engine (C++ multithreaded server): A custom multithreaded C++ server that computes real-time video recommendations based on user interactions and video relationships.
